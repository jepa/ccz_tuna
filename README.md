# Files and folders organization:

In this repository you will find all of the code related to the data analysis. note that all data is available from Bell 
*et al* (2020), see *Data* section below.

## Folders

- `results`: folder containing the results of the manuscript. It is sub-devided in `tbl` containing tables and `fig` containing the figures 

- `scripts`: this folder has the scripts used to do the analysis
  - `functions.R`: script that contains all of the functions needed for the analysis. note that mos functions are adopted from Bell *et al* (2020) 
  - `main_script.R`: this script contains the step-by-step analysis of the data


# Data

The raw data used in this analysis comes from the manuscript lead by J.D. Bell published in the journal *nature sustainability* in 2021 with the title "Pathways to sustaining tuna-dependent Pacific Island economies during climate change". The data is publically available and can be found [here](https://osf.io/qa8w4/). For access to the shapefiles used please contact [The Sea Around Us](http://www.seaaroundus.org/) for the RFMO shapefile and [Jesse van der Grient](https://www.south-atlantic-research.org/2022/07/06/dr-jesse-van-der-grient-joins-the-saeri-team/) for the CCZ shapefiles.
